## Peripheries of violence

Castells argues strongly that

> there is a systemic relationship between the structural transformations \[…\] of the network society and the growing dereliction of the ghetto; the constitution of an informational/global economy, under the conditions of capitalist restructuring; the crisis of the nation state \[…\]; the demise of the patriarchal family \[…\]; the emergence of a global, yet decentralized, criminal economy \[…\]; and the process of political alienation, and communal retrenchment, among the \[…\] poor and disfranchised. (1998, p.138)

The frameworks of *Los olvidados* and *Pixote* are, ultimately, psychoanalytical and national: psychoanalytical because they invoke a Freudian framework of disturbed family structures (substitute paternal and maternal relationships); and national because, although each director virulently questions the dominant discourses and images of the nation (and, at least in the case of Buñuel, decries any kind of nationalism), the critique of dominant national images still posits the nation as its ultimate framework.^[The documentary-style prologue to *Los olvidados*, with its mention of the global problem of poverty in the great cities of the world, is very much an afterthought, either ironic in its paternalistic tones, or an (unsuccessful) attempt to anaesthetize knee-jerk reactions against the film’s “unacceptable” images of  Mexico.] What differentiates them from the films of the 1990s is that the latter insist on the *systemic* relationships at work in their representation of interstitial violence, the lacerations and gashes in the screen of globalization. They hint at the linkages – but also the particularity of the linkages – between crime-violence-poverty in one place and global flows of wealth in another; they engage in “a global sense of place” and expose “the *power geometry* of time-space compression” (Massey 1994, p.149).^[Time-space compression is a term used by (e.g. 1989) and others to signify the speed-up of communications experienced as the annihilation of space within the regimes of deregulated, “flexible”, global capitalist accumulation.]

*Pizza, birra, faso* \[“Pizza, beer, fags”\] was made in Argentina in 1997 by a couple of young, virtually unknown directors – Bruno Stagnaro and Adrián Caetano – on the shoestring budget (for a feature film) of US \$400,000, and has been credited by the influential film review *El amante cine* with having substantially changed the course of recent Argentine cinema (Noriega 2001). The film’s new visual style and challenging themes are evident from the credit sequence: instead of the immobile establishing shots of traditional filmic discourse (such as those in the documentary prologue to *Los olvidados*), we are presented with a frenetically speeding camera, a rush of movement in a fragmented cityscape where the *durée* of place has been replaced by velocity, smeared into a blur along lines of transportation and displacement. The credit sequence sets the scene for the violent mugging of a businessman in a Buenos Aires taxi by two of the youths who are the subject of the film, working in league with a corrupt taxi driver. The camera is hyper-mobile to the point of disorientation, showing frantically edited snippets of city bustle, either filmed from some fast-moving mode of transport or jerkily hand-held, twisting this way and that as if time itself had gone into overdrive, while the audio track is overlain with radio transmissions by the police and radio news reports about city violence, unemployment, and crime. The audio and visual representation of transport and (electronic) communications systems, key components of time-space compression, creates an overwhelming effect: not only is the camera almost always travelling in the opening sequences, but at least five types of rapidly moving transport are signalled: cars, taxis, buses, trains, and the businessman’s missed aeroplane (implying global space). That such transport signifies velocity and time-space compression, is obvious, but that velocity and rate substitute for temporal depth in the global megalopolis is carefully signalled by a close-up of the taxi-driver’s digital clock in the roof of his car at the beginning of the taxi-mugging sequence.
