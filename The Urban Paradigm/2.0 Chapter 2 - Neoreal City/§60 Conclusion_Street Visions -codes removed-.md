## Conclusion

Like all of these films, *Amores perros* poses questions about visibility and invisibility, and in particular about (in)visibility as simulation and dissimulation. In *Los olvidados*, as Evans points out (p.86), the blind Don Carmelo, referring to the street children he has been abusing, cites the Spanish proverb “cría cuervos …”, leaving implicit the corollary “y te sacarán los ojos” \[“bring up crows, and they’ll peck out your eyes”\]. In one of the closing scenes of *Pixote*, the young boy vomits while staring transfixed at the *television screen* he and his now dead friends had bought with the proceeds of their crimes: what remains of their lives is now a flat televisual surface, and his vomit is the accumulation of all that somehow does not fit within the sanitized screens of Brazilian society. In *Pizza, birra, faso*, the protagonists attempt to get into a glitzy nightclub from which they are barred by virtue of their social status: their bodies must remain invisible, slinking in the dark and dangerous corners of the city, and violence is the only way for them to transgress the spatial lines of power which govern the right of access to public visibility. In *La vendedora de rosas*, the orphan Mónica stares through a plate-glass shop window, a kind of virtual screen, at an absurd commodified Santa Clause with its synthesized Christmas jingle; she hears a scraping noise, jarring against the jingle, and looks round to see a woman dragging her entire impoverished family along the street on a go-cart. Finally, in *Amores perros*, the old tramp and ex-guerrilla El Chivo makes strategic use of his social invisibility to transgress the power-lines of the city, violently shattering the plate-glass screen of a Japanese restaurant with his assassin’s bullet, or playing, literally, with his image as he sticks a photograph of himself into his estranged daughter’s graduation photograph. As such, he is the perfect corollary for the image-conscious Valeria, who, with her carefully simulated TV-relationships fabricated for global televisual consumption, is forced to confront the lack which those images disavow, as the car crash leaves her beautiful body mutilated and amputated. Her image on the advertising hoarding for global beauty product manufacturer *Enchant* is thus revealed as pure façade and simulation. It is the screen of a violence whose very terms cannot be understood without thinking its linkages to the power-geometry of informational global capitalism.
