## Part I: The Protecting Veil

Let me show my first clip which is from *Batalla en el cielo*. Now you all know the infamous non-simulated fellatio with which the film begins, and I’ll spare you that and will just cut in at the point of transition to the most blatant example of public space in this film, which follows straight on from the opening sequence:

> CLIP 1 – Fellatio – Zócalo

Now, the very deliberately chosen music for that sequence is John Tavener’s spiritual piece entitled *The Protecting Veil* for Cello and orchestra. From what, we may ask ourselves, is the veil protecting either the characters or us in this film? Setting aside its spiritual meaning for a moment, the veil can clearly stand as a synecdoche for the screen, or vice versa, the screen can stand as synecdoche for the veil, since both screen and veil are devices that reveal paradoxically by covering up or hiding something. How does the veil-screen articulate the relationship between the most intimate experiences of the body and its insertion as symbolic being within public space, the coercive or consensual rituals of public space, and the symbolic deployments or subtractions of sovereignty that structure public space, which are here represented iconically by the early morning ritual of flag-raising over the Zócalo? How can this protecting veil spread over and bring into the same imaginary space a scene of real or imagined fellatio and the most iconic “public space”, perhaps, in Mexico?

The spiritual meaning of the “protecting veil” is the skepi or protection of the mother of god in the Orthodox Church by which Mary extends her veil over the people of the church as a form of or promise of intercession, and this is the inspiration for Tavener’s piece, given his Russian Orthodox faith.

Yet what is precisely articulated in this opening sequence is on the one hand a bodily act that is arguably not veiled, which is to say not fetishized at least on first appearances, and on the other a public ritual which symbolically founds and repeats sovereignty, the most basic ritual of sovereignty of the Mexican State. To translate this idea into contemporary theoretical terms, we might say that what is articulated at the opening of *Batalla en el cielo* is the conjoining of *bios* – as in the biological – and *nomos* – as in the legal or the customary. This conjoining of *bios* and *nomos* is what, for Foucault, is the most distinctive characteristic of modern sovereignty, which he terms biopower, in the sense that the modern state exercises sovereignty through regulating biological life itself.

Yet this is not, of course, a sufficient explanation, because these two Ur-szene are *not* perfectly conjoined, for one seems to belong to a realm that seems to resist incorporation into the other. In the words of Italian Political theorist Roberto Esposito, QUOTE “there is a semantic void, \[an\] interval of meaning which remains open in Foucault's text between the constitutive poles of the concept of biopolitics, namely, biology and politics” (45). I think we feel that semantic void here, and not only because of the deliberate mismatch of age, class, race and body form that seem designed to challenge the most liberal-minded spectator in 2005, before the widespread normalization of Internet pornography. Certainly the British film censors decided that the public needed the protection of the veil, and censored the opening and other explicit sections of the film on its first release in the UK.

And indeed, such censorship – such protection – conforms precisely to what Esposito proposes as the missing term in the modern relationship between biology and politics, whereby biopolitics is the subordination, disciplining and training of the body by power, i.e. a relationship of subordination and internalization of power, whose modern paradigm is the panopticon. The missing term that allows us to understand the relationship between biology and power in more subtle terms is *immunization* or *immunity*. We can initially understand this term as a protective impulse against perceived external harm. I quote Esposito:

> Rather than being superimposed or juxtaposed in an external form that subjects one to the domination of the other, in the immunitary paradigm, *bíos* and *nomos*, life and politics, emerge as the two constituent elements of a single, indivisible whole that assumes meaning from their interrelation. Not simply the relation that joins life to power, immunity is the power to preserve life. (45-46)

The secret of the protection afforded by the protecting veil may, then, be a form of *immunitas*. The term is introduced by Esposito as a way of understanding the mechanisms by which *bios* gives rise to *nomos* in the form of Hobbesian self-preservation, the *conservatio vitae* which makes the individual’s survival conditional on his subordination to an external sovereign power. But wait, isn’t this counterintuitive? Why must the protection of self-preservation take the negative form of *immunitas* as opposed to the positive form of *communitas*? And would *communitas* not be a more obvious analogue of Christian communion as the protection afforded Mary’s veil? I shall come back to this point later, after we’ve taken a little spatial detour as demanded by the theme of our conference.
