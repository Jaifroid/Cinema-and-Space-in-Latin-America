## Part III: Proper Security, or, Secure Property

I think there is little doubt that, despite Reygadas’ protestations to the contrary, his placing of improper bodies in improper juxtapositions at the point of intersection of different spatialities or spatial regimes is intended to produce, at least at first, neo-avant-garde shock in his audience. Although he claims merely to be showing sex between real people warts and all – be they short, fat, squat, punky, old, flabby, or whatever – rather than the fetishized sex of tasteful Hollywood simulation, his choices don’t seem as innocent as he protests, which is no doubt his prerogative as *auteur*. There is something here of that surrealist fascination with the body as explosive or resistant to power that fed into a long Mexican neo-surrealist tradition on the one hand and into Lefebvre’s reading of the body in space on the other (and, incidentally, into the Deleuzian fascination with, for example, the becoming-animal of the human). Lefebvre wrote that “the body, at the very heart of space \[…\] is irreducible and subversive” (*The Survival of Capitalism*), and it is precisely the tension between such avant-garde investments in the body's “subversive” relationship to space and the now dominant Foucauldian understanding of the body’s biopolitical legibility at the heart of social space, that lies, I believe, at the core of Reygadas' filmmaking.

*Post tenebras lux* appeared, as I said, in 2012 at the culmination of Calderón’s war on drugs and ramping up of an apparatus and paradigm of state power predicated on security as an explicitly biopolitical matter, as commented on by Williams, Claudio Lomnitz and many others. As usual, Reygadas’ relationship to the public political discourse is oblique, this time undertaken through an apparently innocent home-movie aesthetic, reminiscent of increasingly distant family camcorder footage of the 1990s and early 2000s – and Reygadas even has his own very young children, Ruth and Eleazar, acting themselves in the film. Yet spatially what is recorded here, I think, in the apparently idyllic countryside home life and the focus on extended family as the outer limit of the social, is in fact the complete collapse of any concept of “public space”, or even of a public sphere, that has been swallowed up in the immunitary paradigm of *conservatio vitae*. Esposito explains, I quote:

> Tracing it back to its etymological roots, *immunitas* is revealed as the negative or privatory form of *communitas*. If *communitas* is that relation, which in binding its members to an obligation of reciprocal donation, jeopardizes individual identity, *immunitas* is the condition of dispensation from such an obligation and therefore the defense against the expropriating features of *communitas*. *\[…\]* One can say that generally *immunitas*, to the degree it protects the one who bears it from risky contact with those who lack it, restores its own borders that were jeopardized by the common. But if immunization implies a substitution or an opposition of private or individualistic models with a form of communitary organization -- whatever meaning we may wish to attribute to such an expression -- the structural connection with the processes of modernization is clear. (50-51)

I think the well known political lines of this opposition are clear by now, so I am going to show a compilation of clips from the film, and will then use my commentary on them as a form of conclusion. These clips come from the beginning and middle of the film, and they jump around temporally and spatially in a way that is not unrepresentative of the film’s spatio-temporal jumps and alternate timelines.

The following phrase from Esposito could stand, I think, as the summation of all of these clips: QUOTE “The negative of *immunitas* already fills our entire frame: in order to save itself unequivocally, life is made ‘private’ in the two meanings of the expression. It is privatized and deprived of that relation that exposes it to its communal mark” (61). Suffice it to say that the notion of the “public” is played out here only as its simulacrum in the British “public school” system: that peculiar British definition of the “public”, which includes “public ownership” via the stock market and “public limited companies”, a definition that no doubt derives from and is connected to the Hobbesian immunitary paradigm and its spill over into the conflation of property and identity in Locke. Note how the erstwhile power of avant-garde shock has, in this film, finally reached its own self-absorption, as Duchamp becomes the name of a room in a sauna swingers club, and *jouissance*, literally in the sequence following straight on from the one I ended on, is subsumed into an Internet porn addiction that definitively immunizes Juan and Natalia against any affective exchange.

The final term in the immunitary paradigm which was and is in full swing in Mexico is, of course, private property, its defence as privilege, its attachment to the identity of the subject, its status as the repository of capital, and its genealogical reproduction in the body and identity of the child. I would thus dare to venture that *Post tenebras lux* exposes, finally, the intimate pedagogy in which the collapse of Mexican public space is played out.
