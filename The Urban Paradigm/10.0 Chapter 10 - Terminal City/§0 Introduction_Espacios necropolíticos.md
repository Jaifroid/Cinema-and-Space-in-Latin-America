# Espacios necropolíticos: inmunidad y comunidad en la megaciudad (*Batalla en el cielo*, dir. Carlos Reygadas, 2005, y *Carancho*, dir. Pablo Trapero, 2010)

The main theme that I would like to explore today concerns the shifts, or mutations, in the biopolitical paradigms of modernity that occur under conditions of megapolitan life. The megacity, as a "new spatial form" in the words of Manuel Castells, profoundly reconfigures corporeality as well as bodily interaction, along with its by now familiar, if no less disorientating, reconfiguration of time and space. It also clearly challenges the biopolitical paradigms of the modern nation-state, along with its well known spatial challenge to the geopolitical topology of the nation-state system. The two cases I shall examine in these terms are the megapolitan spaces of Mexico City and Buenos Aires as they are engaged in two films by Latin American filmmakers whose work displays perhaps the most sustained cinematic thinking on the biopolitics and necropolitics of space over their careers to date: Carlos Reygadas, here represented with his film *Batalla en el cielo* of 2005, and Pablo Trapero, with his film *Carancho* of 2010.

We are all familiar with the neurological model of metropolitan modernity proposed by Georg Simmel and Siegfried Kracauer, and transformed dialectically by Walter Benjamin: the perceptual, as well as physical, shocks and jolts which are registered in mental life for the former, and which surrealistically blast open the continuum of bourgeois corporeal discipline (bound to the service of commodity production) for the latter. The traces of such dialectics may persist in the megacity, but they are shattered, splintered by forces of abstraction. Surrealist encounter and juxtaposition may persist, precariously, in the megapolitan confusion of temporalities and spatialities in Latin America -- a faint echo of the erstwhile marvellous or monstrous hybridities generated from colonial nonsynchronism -- or in the unlikely encounter between bodies thrust together by chance. But such hybridities have been subsumed into postmodern or posthuman assemblage, and, in the megacity, have lost their capacity to act as a locus for transformation or transgression, let alone rapture (Rausch). What does it mean, for example, that a protagonist of one of the films I shall examine is addicted to injecting herself with an opioid -- Fentanyl -- not in order to attain the modern artificial paradise extolled by Baudelaire, the Surrealists and Benjamin, but in order to anaesthetize herself against an excess of unprocessed affect?

 In the necropolitical context of culture from the global south -- and yes, I'm fully aware that Mexico, situated in North America, fruitfully troubles any geographical complacency with regard to the "south" --, in such a context where, in the words of AbdouMaliq Simone, the problems and contradictions of capitalist accumulation are almost always “displaced onto the poor” (*City Life From Jakarta to Dakhar*, p.26), is it any longer possible to assert the irreducibility of the body and its polyrrhythms, as Henri Lefebvre was wont to do in his proto-Deleuzian moments of Surrealist nostalgia? Here is a typical example:
 
> Spinoza says that we do not know what the body is capable of. The foundation of needs and desire, of representations and concepts, the philosophical subject and object, and what is more (and better), the basis of all praxis and all reproduction: this human body resists the reproduction of oppressive relations—if not frontally, then obliquely. […] It is the body which is the point of return, the redress—not the Logos, nor “the human”. (Lefebvre, *The Survival of Capitalism*, p.89)

My contention is that to understand the new forms of power and dereliction that are enacted through the human body under conditions of megapolitan life, it is no longer sufficient to evoke the body and its jouissance, or its schizophrenic stroll, as some last, essential or autopoeitic mode of resistance.
