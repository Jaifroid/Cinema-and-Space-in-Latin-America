## Conclusion

Both *Sur* and *Últimas imágenes del naufragio* are clearly caught up in a nostalgic, backward-looking gaze at the narratives of the past, scanning them for some hint of a potential difference which might generate a flash of light capable of illuminating the future. The need to understand what had led the Argentinians into the crisis of the bloody military dictatorship, to understand that long process of decline from the hayday of the 1920s with its giddy modernity, through the grand narratives of social organization of nationalism, Peronism and socialism, to the social and economic collapse of the 1980s, and the desire to know what to do in order to rebuild a *future* community, lie behind the interwoven themes of these films and their different narrative impulses. “El error, durante todo ese tiempo”, says Roberto in the last words of the film, “fue buscar la gran salvación. No existe. No existen las grandes salvaciones. Algún día lo sabrás. Quizá, si existe alguna, sólo se trate de pequeñas salvaciones, como vos, o como tu madre \[. . . \]” (1:58). As he says these words, the camera zooms out to reveal that he is talking to his baby in the idyllic country setting of the film’s opening sequence. Although the film provides no “solution”, it clearly signals that the mistakes of the past were bound up with the search for transcendental social narratives, and, while signalling the end of metanarrative which we are told is a characteristic of postmodernity, it concretizes its image of future community in the body of a child. *Sur*, similarly, allegorizes the end of the long, backward-looking night of anguish, its preoccupation with the past, in terms of the return “home”, to Rosi, to the “South”, and emphasizes this in the words of its last tango, over which the credits roll:

> Vuelvo al Sur,\
> como se vuelve siempre al amor…\
> Vuelvo a vos,\
> con mi deseo, con mi temor. \[ . . . \]\
> Sueño el Sur,\
> inmensa luna, cielo al revés.\
> Busco el Sur,\
> el tiempo abierto y su después.\
> Quiero al Sur,\
> su buena gente, su dignidad.\
> Siento el Sur,\
> como tu cuerpo, en la intimidad…  (1:52)

*Sur* seems less self-conscious of the problems raised by this conflation of the South and its destiny with the woman’s body, than does *Últimas imágenes…* in its similar return to the “human family”. The last images of that film show Roberto walking back across the pumpkin fields as evening draws near with his son strapped into a rucksack on his back, and as he talks to him of Paradise and the Fall, it is impossible not to notice that the baby’s arms are spread in the form of a cross. The same grand narratives persist, and the film knows it, in the micronarratives of the personal and the familiar. Nevertheless, both films perhaps stand as the last snapshots of an era which believed in them a little too much.

Do the endings of these films represent a capitulation to depoliticization, a retreat into “family and home” at a moment when multinational capital announces the death of ideology and sets the limits of the knowable community at the nuclear family itself? Yes and no. Perhaps due to commercial pressures, few films — and few articles — can resist the “sense of an ending”, the temptation to close and repeat the only allowable narrative closure. Moreover, both films inevitably comply with catharsis, with the need to examine, *and then to close*, a horrendous chapter in Argentine history. That they bow to this pressure is almost inevitable, maybe even necessary. Read another way, however, the films leave off where the future begins, consciously placing themselves at a point of juncture where past and present constellate in the domain of future possibility. By mapping out those constellations, they demand a future no longer tied to the repressions and silences of the past.
