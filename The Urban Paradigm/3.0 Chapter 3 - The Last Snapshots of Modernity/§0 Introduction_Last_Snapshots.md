# Chapter Three - The Last Snapshots of Modernity
Argentine Cinema After the “Process”
------------------------------------------------------------

> It’s a very long and difficult job  \[ . . . \] to carry through this very powerful task, which is to see how, in the very detail of composition, a certain social structure, a certain history, discloses itself.  — Raymond Williams^[In conversation with Edward Said, “Media, Margins and Modernity” (1986), *The Politics of Modernism: Against the New Conformists*, ed. Tony Pinkney (London: Verso, 1989) pp. 177-97 (p. 185).]

The historicization of that *structure of feeling* which we call “modernity” is both a necessary task and a paradoxical one.^[The term “structure of feeling” is taken from Raymond Williams, and I use it deliberately to designate a non-homogenous complex of emerging cultural, social and political formations which feed upon and interact with each other. See, for example, *Marxism and Literature* (Oxford University Press, 1977) pp. 128-35.]  It is necessary because it is becoming ever more urgent to understand why modernity has failed us in its æsthetic and political projects, or in other words, at what point the blueprints for a “knowable community” that it offered on so many different fronts, whether purely linguistic or thoroughly materialist, dissolved into the unknowing, specular surfaces of a “post”-modernity now fully incorporated (as fashion) into the multinational phase of capitalist production. To historicize modernity is also a paradoxical task because, in the words of Tony Pinkney, its awareness of itself as *modern* announces “merely the empty flow of time itself”, and its self-periodization is offered only as a break with the “mythic or circular (non)-temporality of the organic community” — a break that has always already occurred no matter which moment one chooses as its starting point.^[Pinkney, “Modernism and Cultural Theory”, editor’s introduction to Raymond Williams, *The Politics of Modernism*, pp. 1-29 (p. 3).]  Nevertheless, this understanding of the infinite expandability of the modern, and the infinite regress of its origins, remains caught up within modernism’s internal ideology. It might therefore be more helpful to try to show how different cultural products are now attempting to trace modernity as their own prehistory, to “frame” it together with the æsthetic and political debates that it raised in order to better understand the conditions under which culture today can hope to map out the ideological terrain within which it operates, but which has become unthinkable as such.

I shall argue that this framing attempt is similar to Fredric Jameson’s notion of “cognitive mapping”, which might be roughly described as the process by which we unconsciously cast our own image onto the invisible screen of national sociopolitical space and its interface with the world-political system.^[Jameson, *The Geopolitical Æsthetic: Cinema and Space in the World System* (London: British Film Institute, 1992) p. 3 *et passim*. The concept of cognitive mapping is in fact adapted from the geographer Kevin Lynch.]  Cultural artefacts, in this reading, can under certain circumstances be seen as imaginary forms of mediation between the micropolitical and the macropolitical, doing this unconscious work of integration within a world system that attempts to disarticulate any conscious linkage between the local and the global — between, say, the food on the dinner table and Third World debt, to give too obvious an example. Jameson examines the particular form of “conspiracy film” in this context and also looks at other filmic texts for a less ultimate form of allegorical thinking in which can be glimpsed what he now terms the “geopolitical unconscious”. While I cannot here hope to provide his kind of analytical scope, I believe that by focusing on a precise reading of two contemporary filmic narratives from Argentina, a country which situates itself, often consciously, on the productive *margins* of the world system, be it culturally or economically, it becomes possible to gain some precise understanding of the urgency with which “Third” culture is attempting to think that system from a standpoint where its formations become simultaneously more brutally visible and more insidiously conspiratorial. Moreover, in their attempt to “frame” modernity (i.e., both to relativize it and to impute it) at a moment when the country was emerging from a ruthless dictatorship whose geopolitical determinants had been consciously stage-managed by the military itself, these texts are, I believe, trying to think their way *through* modernity and its postmodern corporations to modes of resistance, autonomy and self-representability. The films I shall be examining in this context are *Sur* (South, 1988) by the well-known director Fernando Solanas, veteran experimenter in filmic form and inaugurator of the concept of “Third Cinema”, and *Últimas imágenes del naufragio* (Last Images of the Shipwreck, 1989) by his lesser known contemporary Eliseo Subiela.^[*Sur* (Buenos Aires: Cinesur Argentina, Pacific Productions and Canal Plus France) 115 mins; *Últimas imágenes del naufragio* (Buenos Aires: Cinequanon Argentina and TVE Televisión Española) 120 mins.]
