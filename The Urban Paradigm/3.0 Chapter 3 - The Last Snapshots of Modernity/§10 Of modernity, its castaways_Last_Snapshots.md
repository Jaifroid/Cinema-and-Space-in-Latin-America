## Of modernity, its castaways and shipwrecks

In the present era of multinational globalization, within a techno-cultural climate which has long since declared itself to be postmodern, any harking back to an earlier modernity may seem purely regressive or anachronistic. In order to understand why Argentine film of the late 1980s was still concerned with this historical moment, seeing in it something of a paradigm, it is necessary, firstly, to try to situate the meaning of “modernity” within the context of Argentina, and, secondly, to understand the particularities of film’s own relationship to it. The first requires some discussion of Argentine history, and the second a brief detour through Walter Benjamin’s theorization of photography and film.

Although the cosmopolitan atmosphere of the 1920s is generally associated with the great European cities and with New York, Buenos Aires was no stranger to the overall feeling of modernity and to the explosive outbursts of experimental activity in the arts that accompanied the period.^[For a detailed account see Beatriz Sarlo’s illuminating study of the Argentine experience of modernity, *Una modernidad periférica: Buenos Aires 1920 y 1930*, Colección Cultura y Sociedad (Buenos Aires: Ediciones Nueva Visión, 1988), which has been invaluable to the development of my argument.]  It was a city where a massive influx of European immigrants (before the First World War and then again afterwards) was creating a climate of social and linguistic ferment in which the old structures and the old discourses, dominated by an agrarian élite, were no longer adequate to the mediation of popular aspirations. Nor could those structures respond adequately, on a cultural level, to a world in which the mechanical reproduction of words, speech and images was transforming the ways in which people interacted, and was indeed transforming the social function of such modes of representation — not only print, radio, gramophone and telegraphy, but also cinema, which took an immediate hold in Argentina, so that by 1930 there were over 1,000 cinema salons throughout the country (Sarlo, p. 21). This experience of modernity surfaced of course during the last period of British hegemony over Argentina’s trade and its links with the Imperial world trading system, but I would contend that it is primarily associated with the *decline* of that system of monopoly capitalism, when its structures begin to come under threat — externally from the shift of trading interests towards the United States, and internally from a mobilizing industrial proletariat. Yet, whereas what Linda Hutcheon calls the “messianic faith” of modernism (“the faith that technical innovation and purity of form can assure social order”) was destined to reach its grizzly end in the Nazi concentration camps in Europe,^[Hutcheon, *The Politics of Postmodernism*, New Accents (London: Routledge, 1989) pp. 12, 24.] in Argentina the period of radicalization and growth in popular participation was quashed by the military coup against the populist Hipólito Yrigoyen in 1930, and was supressed throughout the “Infamous Decade” of the thirties until it resurfaced with a vengance with the rise of Juan Domingo Perón in the 1940s.

What this suggests is that the élite urban modernity of the 1920s which we see giving way in the 1930s in Europe to the mass mobilization of the industrialized proletariat under “totalizing” ideologies (fascism in Germany and Italy or revolutionary socialism in Spain, for example) did not in Argentina find a devastating outlet and final check in World War or Civil War, at least not immediately. Argentina, then, suffers what we might call a “delayed modernity” which reaches deep into the totalizing core of Peronism with its blend of neo-fascist personalist rule, the quasi-socialist championing of workers’ rights and income redistribution, and the nationalist promise of industrial greatness on the backs of the ordered and mobilized masses.

Yet what is the relevance of this delayed modernity to the Argentina of the 1980s, just emerging from the latest and bloodiest of its military dictatorships? One answer might be to view the period of military rule which began in 1976 as the violent culmination of the process of transition from the industrial modernization of the Peronist state-led economy of the 1940s and ’50s, with its emphasis on nationalization and unionization, to a multinational “free-market” economy which demanded the complete destruction of the images of social utopia to which Peronism (of the right and the left) and socialism had appealed, and hence, in contrast to its economic “liberalism”, the severest forms of social repression (euphemistically termed *el Proceso*). The violence of the dictatorship would result from a conjunction of three factors: firstly, the perceived need to eradicate once and for all the (albeit false) image of Peronist collectivist utopia after the failed experiment of the second Peronist régime and its aftermath (1973-76); secondly, and closely related to this, a ruthless neo-liberal backlash in the name of free-markets and economic deregulation by which the various ruling élites attempted to align themselves with the (for them) lucrative flows of multinational capital; and finally, the particular dynamics of international Cold War politics and the military’s paranoid self-styled rôle at the forefront of the Western World’s struggle against “international communist subversion”. The period of redemocratization, in which the films are set, is itself a contradictory moment of rekindled utopian joy and of a profound crisis of consciousness, a call to account for the social cost of that “Process” (*la deuda interna*), in the midst of the compulsive drives of hyper-inflation, the social dissolution of mass unemployment, and the rescheduling of an unpayable foreign debt (*la deuda externa*).^[*La deuda interna* (renamed *Verónico Cruz*) was the title of a film by Miguel Pereira (1987) following the life of a peasant boy from Tucumán through to his death on board the General Belgrano, sunk by British submarine fire during the Malvinas/Falklands war.]  At the same time, Argentine culture begins a profound re-examination of the ideologies and promises of this delayed modernity, scanning the horizon for a flash of light, for some clue of its cultural co-ordinates and of the direction in which to proceed.

But what of film’s own internal modernism? Walter Benjamin’s discussion of photography and film in his famous essay of 1936 attempts to work out the socially and historically differentiated relationship of these media to the changing mode of production within mass society. As forms which only exist in terms of mechanical reproduction, he saw photography and film as paradigmatic of the way in which mass-reproduced artefacts strip art of its “cult value” or “aura”, displacing it by “exhibition value”.^[“The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction”, *Illuminations*, edited by Hannah Arendt, trans. by Harry Zohn (London: Fontana, 1973; repr. 1992) pp. 211-44 (p. 219).]  This can have a politically radical effect (demythification, popular access, etc.), but there is nothing intrinsic within the technologies guaranteeing that they will not be re-absorbed into the system of commodity-manufacture, which functions precisely by projecting the illusion of cult value into the commodity’s exhibition value. The function of any technology of reproduction is, then, socially and historically variable, and Benjamin illustrates this by showing how photography has functioned in radically different æsthetic modes throughout its short history. Early portrait photographs, for example, represent the last outpost of cult value, with the aura emanating “for the last time” from the fleeting expression of a human face (p. 219). Such auratic photography would seem to be in technical opposition to the constellations of chance captured by the contemporary snapshot, whose contingency and unpredictability, Benjamin argues, emancipate the object from aura. Atget’s shots of empty city streets, of long rows of bootlasts, of the café tables after people have finished eating and left — photographs which concentrate on “what was unremarked, forgotten, cast adrift” — are seen as object lessons in de-æsthetification. “Such pictures”, remarks Benjamin, “pump the aura out of reality like water from a sinking ship”.^[“A Small History of Photography”, *One Way Street*, trans. by Edmund Jephcott and Kingsley Shorter (London: Verso, 1985) pp. 240-57 (p. 250).]

Yet for us these images of the flotsam and jetsam of the urban space, of its castaways and shipwrecks, are clearly now distanced and nostalgic, their monochrome greys washed out and fading, and this temporal fading gives them a curious kind of *decaying* aura. Benjamin himself claimed that the surrealists were the first to perceive “the revolutionary energies that appear in the “outmoded”, in the first iron constructions, the first factory buildings, the earliest photos, \[. . . \] fashionable restaurants when the vogue has begun to ebb from them”, claiming that “they bring the immense forces of “atmosphere” concealed in these things to the point of explosion”.^[“Surrealism: The Last Snapshot of the European Intelligentsia” (1929), in *One Way Street*, pp. 225-39 (p. 229).]  Such images, by liberating a revolutionary nihilism, mark out for us, even as they fade, the limits of a capitalist world system in crisis, the margins where its symbolic structures collapse in on themselves. We shall see how both of the Argentine films discussed here are able to draw on the atmospheric forces accumulated in an outmoded modernity in order to signal the critical limits of the territories staked out and absorbed by multinational capital.

In the worldwide capitalist crises of the 1930s, Benjamin saw that still photography was at something of a crossroads, caught between cult aura, revolutionary nihilism, and the glossy surfaces of fashion. The moving images of film, however, were still new enough to retain a certain *potential* (though Hollywood was looming) to be the face of socialist technological utopia. The cine camera could delve into the political unconscious, into the very fabric of the material world, abolishing the distance of aura in its co-penetration of the technological and the real as effectively as a surgeon’s scalpel abolishes social distance and class in its penetration of the human body (“The Work of Art…”, pp. 226-27). Yet in our postmodern age of television and video, film may well play a very different rôle, more akin to that which Benjamin identified for still photography.^[See Jameson (pp. 140-43) for further discussion of this point.]  Not only is the moving picture of cinema itself already ageing and acquiring a cult æsthetic status, but it too may now be poised on the brink between, on the one hand, the shipwrecked meanings and drifting identities of a fading modernity, the nostalgic gaze at the last flickering images of a longed-for transcendence, and on the other, its full incorporation into the video, cable and satellite culture of postmodernity and the corresponding multinational phase of capitalist production. Tony Pinkney, stressing a slightly different yet complementary angle to film’s own “delayed modernism”, suggests that film outside Hollywood was itself forced to re-invent modernism as a strategy of resistance to its full absorption by U.S. corporate capital:

>\[]A\]s it moves into its own new technological phases of sound and colour, film takes a backward somersault behind Modernism, reinventing the latter’s own realist past so thoroughly in the Hollywood domination of the medium that after the Second World War a whole new brand of *auteur* Modernism has to seek all over again to return film “to itself”, to drag it back into that twentieth century whose very epitome it once was. (p. 15)

In the Argentina of the late 1980s, the social imaginary is caught between the nostalgic desire for transcendence and salvation, and the catastrophic dissolution of a lost totality, cast adrift on the margins of a fading modernity. It is my contention that Argentina’s delayed modernity, which I described above, crosses with the delayed modernism of film in its resistance to the (in)corporations of the increasingly unaccountable flows of multinational capital, at the precise historical juncture in which Argentine culture is emerging from the social catastrophe which put a final, brutal end to all its messianic dreams, whether Peronist, socialist or nationalist. It is in this sense that these films represent the last snapshots of that sinking dream of modernity.
