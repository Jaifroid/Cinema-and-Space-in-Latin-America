## Space, Family and Genre

*El Bruto* begins with the staging of a typical urban land struggle between the ageing property magnate Andrés Cabrera, supported by the forces of law and order, and the rebellious occupants of a tenement he owns in the Portales district of Mexico City and which he wishes to demolish so that he can sell the land for urban redevelopment: he has been offered \$250,000 pesos for the plot of land. The (then) working-class Colonia Portales in Benito Suárez was an area of major real-estate speculation and development in the 1950s, with the old ramshackle houses being torn down and replaced with apartment blocks at a feverish rate, so that by 1960 the population of the area had expanded hugely and had become largely middle class (Gobierno Delegacional Benito Suárez, c. 2010). This climate of land speculation and the break-up of semi-communal living conditions makes of the film, amongst other things, a *spatial* expression of class conflict which is mapped out in terms of the power of money to dissolve communities while unleashing new forms of libidinal economy. In the *Grundrisse*, Marx makes the startling statement that while “in money the community is \[…\] a real abstraction”, nevertheless the expression of both wage labour and capital in terms of exchange value means that “money thereby directly and simultaneously becomes the *real community* \[*Gemeinwesen*\]” (Marx, 1993 \[1858\]: 225–26). By opening the film with this scene of social struggle between the abstract representation of space as exchange value and the lived spaces of the community,^[I am here using the terminology of the French philosopher of (urban) space, Henri Lefebvre (1991 \[1974\]: 33 *et passim*).] Buñuel and Alcoriza are directly staging the power of money to dissolve community and *become the real community*, i.e. substitute itself for community as an abstract expression of the relations between people, including the very nucleus of social reproduction: the family.

Indeed, the film’s first short sequence, just before the staging of this socio-spatial conflict, focuses on the relationship between one of the leaders of the tenement community, Don Carmelo, and his teenage daughter Meche, in which already the expected family roles are curiously inverted. Meche is counting out some drops of medicine for her father, telling him to wrap up carefully, giving him his packed lunch, and offering advice on avoiding the rush hour on his bus journey to work at a factory, every bit as if she were a mother sending her child off to school. We assume that Meche’s mother has died, leading to an inversion of the father-daughter relationship. The sequence is significant because it sets up a whole series of inverted family relationships in the film. Don Andrés’ “wife”, Paloma, who had been “saved” by Don Andrés from a mire of debt in which her husband had left her, is young enough to be his daughter and they live with his doddery father whom they treat as if he were an irresponsible child, buying him sweets to reward him and withholding them from him when he is “naughty”. El Bruto lives with a woman who has brought her whole family into their two-room living space, including her bed-ridden but apparently perfectly able-bodied mother and her crippled beggar-uncle, all of them dependent on El Bruto’s wages as a slaughterhouse worker. El Bruto is both protected and exploited by his “boss” Don Andrés as his (illegitimate) son without overt recognition of the fact, yet, after Don Andrés instructs him to abandon his dependent family in order to service the former’s money interests, El Bruto ends up sleeping with Paloma, his putative step-mother, then making “home” in a hovel on a construction site with the teenage Meche, as a substitute for her father whom he had unintentionally killed, and finally murdering his own father (Don Andrés) in some pre-political realization of the Oedipal drama.

Through this freak show of partial or pathologically Oedipalized family structures, shorn of all but the most cursory nod towards romance — there is not a single “normal” family represented in the film and all of the romantic attachments are provisional, unstable and temporary — Buñuel mercilessly subverts the travails of family romance encoded in popular urban melodramas such as those directed by Roberto Gavaldón and Julio Bracho. Monsiváis notes that Dolores del Río in Gavaldón’s archetypal melodramas (*La otra* \[The Other One\], 1946; *La casa chica* \[The Love Nest\], 1950; *Deseada* \[Deseada\], 1951) is always condemned to psychological submission, her own desire erased (“carece de voluntad”, 1994: 182), while for Ana M. López, even the films starring María Félix, whom Monsiváis sees as a more complex transitional figure, reproduce the desire for the stability of the patriarchal family:

> Easily classified as antifamily melodramas insofar as they reject the surface accoutrements of the patriarchal family, ultimately her films forcefully reinscribe the need for the standard family. Despite titles focusing on the female character, Félix’s films are male-centered narratives, where the specular pleasure lies with the woman (and her masquerades of masculinity), but the narrative remains with a male protagonist. (1993: 155–56)

Somewhat different, however, is the relationship of *El Bruto* to the thoroughly urban *arrabal* films and the related *cabaretera*/prostitute genre. These are fundamentally hybrid films, combining the genres of melodrama, musicals, crime and gangster movies, neorealism and film noir (particularly the “bad girl” movie). Here Buñuel taps into the neorealist mode he had used so effectively in *Los olvidados*, in the representation of the daily struggle for food, work and decent living conditions of the working-class *arrabal* inhabitants, and, bizarrely at first, fuses it with the “dangerous seductress” image already associated with actress Katy Jurado (e.g., as Kitty in Alejandro Galindo’s *Hay lugar para dos* \[Room for Two\] of 1949 or, prototypically, as the fallen woman “who gets up late” in Ismael Rodríguez’ *Nosotros los pobres* \[We the Poor\] of 1948). Buñuel does not engage this hotchpotch in the deliciously chaotic way in which it emerges in *Nosotros los pobres*, which Monsiváis describes as having a plot that is impossible to relay adequately because its unfolding “equivale al fluir de la vida misma” (“is no more or less than the flow of life itself”, 1994: 144–48). Instead, he does so by forcing a productive confrontation and redeployment of the axiomatic^[An axiomatic (*une axiomatique*), in the work of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, is a set of abstract principles of decoding and recoding which govern social existence, such that people’s behaviour comes to be “ruled by *abstractions*” such as “relations of production and exchange”, as Marx put it in the *Grundrisse* (1993 \[1858\]: 164–65), rather than by other individuals (kinship ties, the priest, the despot). The major example of such an abstraction is the capitalist axiom of the equivalence between decoded flows of labour power and decoded flows of money as capital (Deleuze & Guattari 1990 \[1972\]: 225, 237, 246). Money is the *realized* version of this abstraction which in turn renders abstract and fungible all other social codes (cp. also Marx quoted above: “in money the community is \[…\] a real abstraction”).] which governs the *arrabal* film’s compulsive cannibalization of the genres of prurient national melodrama, stylized and voyeuristic “neorealism” (actually closer to the Hispanic picaresque comedy than the Italian model), and contemporary Hollywood crime/noir formats. These genres are already decoded by the *arrabal* films, which is to say turned by the machine of cinema itself into deterritorializing flows of desire and affect exchangeable for the price of a cinema ticket. Buñuel, however, turns his camera on the axiomatic system itself which decodes the (transnational/urban) flow of these bastardized generic formats, which we could initially characterize in terms of such “immanent” axioms as “desire is the plaything of death”, “power creates its own resistance”, and “space is an effect of flows”. These are axioms insofar as they are algorithms regulating the production of modern subjectivity via the capture of affect liberated from the social codes governing traditional societies. In the case of Mexico, the flows captured by the cinema of the 1940s and ’50s are “liberated” from the partial decoding of the traditional Catholic sublimation of sexuality and death, the Revolutionary origins of the modern capitalist state as the dismantling of despotism and the institution of a modern biopolitical order, and the uprooting of hundreds of thousands of post-Revolutionary peasants converging on the burgeoning cities. The said algorithms are embodied, in *El Bruto*, in the Oedipal machinery of cinematic melodrama (framed self-consciously at several points and inverted by Buñuel), the disciplinary state apparatuses (present at the beginning and end of the film in the form of the police as the ultimate arbiters of “brute” life), and the channelling of urban workers’ aspirations into a regime of rent (which in turn requires and produces waged labour to service it).

More broadly, the Freudian axiom of Eros/Thanatos, so compelling for the Surrealists, needs to be understood as a machine in the radical sense that, for Jacques Lacan, the drive is an impersonal, “undead” machine (Žižek, 1997: 89) which pursues its own ends beyond any conscious control exercised by the (illusion of) ego. For its part, the Foucauldian axiom of power/resistance is the machine regulating (and limiting) the production of hegemony and biopolitical administration in the modern (post-Revolutionary) state. While the Lefebvrian axiom of the “production of space”, precipitated from flows of capital and labour, is the inexorable machine which produces the (material) city as an expression of investment flows powered by the twin faces of production and consumption. Yet such “immanent” axioms can also all be subsumed into the larger axiomatic machinery of capitalist exchange, of the “encounter of two sorts of flows”:

> the decoded flows of production in the form of money-capital, and the decoded flows of labor in the form of the “free worker.” Hence, unlike previous social machines, the capitalist machine is incapable of providing a code that will apply to the whole of the social field. By substituting money for the very notion of a code, it has created an axiomatic of abstract quantities that keeps moving further and further in the direction of the deterritorialization of the socius. (Deleuze & Guattari, 1990 \[1972\]: 33)

It is important to stress that Mexican film of this period does not “express” this axiomatic in some naïve representational sense: rather, it *is* the axiomatic in a very real sense, for it subjects all of the “customs” and habits, which the new urban migrants went to the cinema to “learn” according to Monsiváis, to the logic of the *spectacle as commodity*, and hence to the axiom of quantitative equivalence and exchange. Cinema is the very face of technological modernity for the working classes of the Golden Age, a desiring, deterritorializing machine which operates through and on the commodification of bodies and passions, connecting the flows of urban migrants to the transnational flows of images, fashions and wants. It is in this sense that cinema can be understood as a labour of affect which mediates love, hatred, hope, fear, compassion, greed, rage, etc.: on the one hand commodifying these affects for sale, and on the other slowly but surely precipitating an avalanche of new wants, customs and habits, forming a culture of consumption based around image, spectacle, and fashion. What Buñuel does in both *El Bruto* and *Ensayo de un crimen*, in different ways, is to train his camera on the very mode of functioning of this axiomatic field, revealing the release and capture of feminine sexuality and desire as a feedback loop at the heart of the cinematic labour of affect.

In *El Bruto*, it is through the figure of Paloma that Buñuel frames the flight and capture of affect, its interpersonal, excessive, unbounded nature, but also its brute drive, its intimate relation to power, its pushing at the schizophrenic limits of deterritorialized desire. But before engaging the film’s entanglement with these flows, we shall turn to *Ensayo de un crimen* in order to examine Buñuel’s staging of the blind repetition-compulsion of the axiomatic machine.
