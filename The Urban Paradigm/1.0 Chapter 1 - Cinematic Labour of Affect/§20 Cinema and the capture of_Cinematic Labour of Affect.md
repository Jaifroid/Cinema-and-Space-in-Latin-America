## Cinema and the capture of affect

The concept of affect (*affectus*, as distinct from *affectio*, i.e. affection) derives ultimately from the philosophy of Baruch Spinoza, although its contemporary revival is usually credited to Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari’s *A Thousand Plateaus* (1987 \[1980\]), and subsequently to the influential work of Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri (2000). Within these accounts, capitalism is seen to have colonized the “immaterial”, virtual worlds of the mass media (from cinema to, latterly, cyberspace), as the latest manifestation of the quest for a “spatial fix” (Harvey 2001: 284–311) to its internal contradictions. The production of hegemony has always been intimately bound up with the capture of affect, of course, channelling the flow of social affect into fictive national sentiments of “deep, horizontal comradeship” (Anderson, 1983: 7) towards members of the nation, and fear and mistrust towards non-members. But capitalism puts affect into circulation in more complex ways, which partly accounts for its power to transcend localities and re-inscribe them in larger spatial frameworks, as well as for its appeal to libido in order to mobilize the desire for consumption. Putting such forces into play, first of all in the urbanization of capital (as in Mexico City of the 1950s), and in the incipient transnationalization of capital of which (Hollywood) cinema is the pioneer, has radical consequences which are corrosive of the very structures through which the national-popular had attempted to capture and fix affective flows in the first place. For Hardt, in the later postmodern period, labour becomes increasingly both “immaterial” and “affective”, as capital seeks to manage on a global scale, through the co-option of the mass media, the sphere of consumption dominated by image, style, and the unpredictable libidinal attachments of consumers (Hardt, 1999 \[July\]: 94–96). I would argue that cinema in the 1950s, as a transnational capitalist industry engaged in the production of commodified virtual worlds, was already deeply caught up in these processes.

The idea of an economy of affect is not a particularly new one, not only because it stretches back to Spinoza (1994 \[1677\]: 154) for whom affect was a modification of a body’s relation to infinite “substance”, increasing or decreasing its power of activity, but also because it mostly gives us, in its Deleuzian guise, a new vocabulary for something which has been theorized under many different names. In fact one of the reasons for Slavoj Zizek’s differences with Deleuze in, for example, *Organs Without Bodies* (2004), is that psychoanalysis has its own complex vocabulary for the social capture of affect and for what can go wrong with such processes. Deleuze and Guattari’s reframing of Freudian psychoanalysis via Karl Marx’s understanding of the deterritorializations induced by capital (in *Anti-Oedipus*, 1990 \[1972\]) is, in this vocabulary, a critique of psychoanalysis’ attempted capture of affect in order to recontain the dissolvent flows which capitalist modernization unwittingly unleashes (as we shall see).^[Deleuze and Guattari do not, of course, claim to be on the side of capitalism either, for it operates by means of crises, reterritorializing with all its might what it cannot help but deterritorialize in its compulsive outward expansion.] In many ways this critique continues and updates the appropriation and displacement of psychoanalysis begun by the surrealists in the 1920s, which is precisely why Buñuel’s work, produced at the heart of a popular industry in Mexico whose most fundamental characteristic might be its status as a capitalist technology for the commodification of affect, provides a potent filmic frame for the staging of these contradictory flows.
