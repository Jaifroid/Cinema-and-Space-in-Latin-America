## Taming the Brute

*El Bruto* and *Ensayo de un crimen* (together with *Él* \[This Strange Passion, 1953\]) have been seen as belonging to Buñuel’s “macho-dramas” which “emphasiz\[e\] the correlations between \[…\] troubled men and the image of a state in crisis” (Acevedo-Muñoz, 2003: 124), a correlation which tends to be thought of in allegorical terms. Thus both films’ male protagonists, Pedro “the Brute”, and Archibaldo the aristocratic dandy, are made to stand for the crisis in the social role of machismo as providing the ideological glue or pact between the state and the citizenry, particularly the peasantry and the newly industrialized working classes (an argument expounded for a later period by Ramírez Berg \[1992: 107\]). In the case of *El Bruto*, Acevedo-Muñoz argues, Buñuel uses and ironically frames the star status of the lead actor Pedro Armendáriz, who had personified the ideology of machismo in the films of Emilo Fernández, in order to suggest the untenability of this stereotype in the midst of the rapid but ramshackle modernization of Mexico. Buñuel casts Armendáriz distinctly “against type” (2003: 126) in the suggestible, gullible, manipulated and dim-witted figure of El Bruto, a slaughterhouse worker who becomes a henchman for an ageing capitalist, Don Andrés, but ends up as a pawn in the hands of Don Andrés’ young wife, Paloma, a femme fatale played by Katy Jurado. In the case of *Ensayo de un crimen*, Buñuel casts “Ernesto Alonso, a soap opera star who never married” (2003: 139) in the role of a debonair bachelor whose “latent homosexuality” (2003: 138) supposedly surfaces in his (unrealized) desires to murder women.

While suggestive and certainly in the line of Buñuel’s questioning of the identitarian rhetoric of Mexican (filmic) nationalism, this reading misses what is a crucial focus in both films. If machismo is in crisis in the 1950s, it is not allegorical of some imminent national crisis, for these are in fact the years of the so-called “Mexican miracle” which did not come to an end until the oil shocks of the 1970s, and indeed machismo remained an available discourse, whether as compensation for subaltern injury, or by dint of *droit de seigneur* amongst the propertied classes, or indeed as a state-sponsored power pact under the PRI’s vertical structures of patronage-as-patriarchy, well into the 1990s. Something else was set in circulation, and recorded in these films, which was much more corrosive than the iconoclastic deployment of a stereotyped “homosexuality” by Buñuel against the image of strong macho identity (a reading which might work for *Él* but which seems particularly forced in the case of *Ensayo de un crimen*, where the protagonist is clearly attracted to women sexually even as he fantasizes eliminating female sexuality by eliminating the women themselves (although for a much more nuanced account of gender ambiguity and the construction of a queer subject position in *Ensayo de un crimen*, see Gutiérrez-Albilla, 2008: 117–46.). The unprecedented urban construction boom which Buñuel recorded in *Los olvidados* (1950), and which is the cause of the immediate social conflict in *El Bruto* (Don Andrés wants to demolish the housing where his tenants live in order to sell the plot for redevelopment), points us towards a more profound set of processes which were fundamentally reorganizing social and family relationships, and with them the conventional mappings of social power and libidinal investments. And while it is true that Buñuel self-reflexively uses the popular star system and popular generic formulae in *El Bruto*, what is being framed is not so much the figure of the macho, as the role played by popular cinema itself, particularly the urban genre of the *cine de arrabal* (slum melodrama) — as the key interface between the urban populace and technological modernity — in this remapping of the libidinal economy of Mexican society. This is why the real interest of both films lies not in the emasculation of their protagonists, but in the changing sexuality of *women* as an index of their pushing at the boundaries of their affective capture within the institution of the patriarchal family. This decoding of the flows — of affect and libido together with money — has everything to do with the deterritorializations induced by urbanization, by national and international capital flows, and their imaginary entanglement in the indisciplined vision machine of popular cinema. This also helps to explain why the *cine de arrabal* (the popular genre of the slum melodrama which *El Bruto* both engages and parodies) came under increasing attack from reactionary social forces such as the Catholic *Liga de la Decencia* (Legion of Decency) from 1953 onwards (González Rodríguez, 1993: 42–43).
