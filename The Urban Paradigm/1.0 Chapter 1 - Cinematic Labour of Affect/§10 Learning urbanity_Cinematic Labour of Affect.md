## Learning urbanity

It has often been suggested that Mexican film of the 1940s and ’50s had a pedagogical role as a tool for the formation of a “citizenry” in the dual sense of imparting urbanity (the know-how for finding one’s place, socially and imaginatively, in the metropolis) and for producing a social imaginary of post-Revolutionary citizenship. In an early, much-cited text on Mexican cinema, Carlos Monsiváis used the expression: “No se accedió al cine a soñar: se fue a aprender” (“People did not go to the cinema to dream: they went to learn”, cited in Martín-Barbero, 1998: 180). What is often left out of the quotation, however, is that what people went to the cinema to learn about, Mosiváis suggests, were “hábitos” and “códigos de costumbres” (“habits and codes of conduct”), many of them caught up in narratives of capitalist modernization, rather than some prefabricated model of Mexican national identity. Nevertheless, in his later work, Monsiváis explicitly figures film in terms of a psychic mirror for collective identity formation via family romance:

> Cada película es, en el sentido psíquico, un espejo a lo largo de la sala. A este “ser como los que contemplan”, mucho le deben actores de reparto, primeras figuras, escenógrafos, directores y camarógrafos. Ellos, al urdir un país también llamado México, lo hacen finalmente de acuerdo con quienes, en butaca o en sillas, reelaboran los sucedidos de la pantalla y los trasforman en mitologías y cultura familiar, en depósito vivencial de las generaciones. \[…\] El público se deja “adoptar” casi literalmente por el cine, y comparte sus filias y fobias: las ganas de conmoverse para sentirse vivos \[…\]. (Monsiváis & Bonfil, 1994: 65)^[“Every film is, in the psychic sense, a mirror along the full length of the theatre. This “being-as-those-who-contemplate” is largely down to repertory actors, lead actors, set designers, directors and cameramen. As they fashion a country also called Mexico, they do so in collaboration with those who, in stalls or seats, rework the events on screen and transform them into mythologies and family culture, into the living resource of successive generations. \[…\] The audience allows itself to be “adopted”, almost literally, by cinema, and shares its likes and dislikes: the desire to experience emotion in order to feel alive \[…\].”]

Such specular imagery, together with that of family-predicated identity metaphors, abounds, unsurprisingly, in the narratives of identity formation that have been told with regard to Mexican film (see, for example, *Mexican Cinema: Reflections of a Society*, Mora, 1989, as well as the book in question here, *A través del espejo* \[Through the Mirror\]) Generally the mirror imagery is used “naively” to suggest a mimetic or reflective relationship between genre film and the popular classes who incorporated film-going into their weekly ritual during the 1930s-50s. Occasionally (and this is implicitly Monsiváis’ approach) it is used in a more complex, quasi-Lacanian/Althusserian mode of identity formation and construction by which film is seen to interpellate its audience, suturing them into a narrative of citizenship (as much imagined, fantasized and “felt” as actually appearing on screen) that conjoins family romance (as the basis of melodrama) to national identity construction.^[Louis Althusser (1971) famously extended Jacques Lacan’s theory of the mirror stage as a point of passage for the child through the Imaginary into the Symbolic Order with his concept of “interpellation”, whereby the social order calls on the individual to take up his or her place as subject of that order through the mode of (self-)recognition. Christian Metz (1981 \[1977\]) later applied this schema to cinema, whereby film itself is seen as the “imaginary signifier” constructing an alluring subject position for the spectator within the film’s chain of signification.]

While it is undoubtedly the case that the governments of Manuel Ávila Camacho and Miguel Alemán Valdés saw film as an instrument for constructing hegemony during the rapid modernization of the peasantry and formation of an industrial proletariat, and by the late 1940s had established significant state investment in the industry by means of credit and direct state funding of alternative distribution channels, there are nevertheless a couple of problems with the quasi-Althusserian approach to interpellation of the citizenry via cinema. The first is that the interpellative model implicitly subsumes at least part of cinema’s function into an ideological apparatus of the state, a quasi-disciplinary institution on a par with schools, the police and belletristic pedagogy, while generally ignoring an “affective excess” in popular film which is distinctly *indisciplinary*, which decomposes pseudo-Oedipal state-family structures (and to which Buñuel addresses a large part of his work). The second is a general critique of interpellation which, in the words of Judith Butler, “presupposes not only that the inculcation of conscience already has taken place, but that conscience, understood as the psychic operation of a regulatory norm, constitutes a specifically psychic and social working of power on which interpellation depends but for which it can give no account” (Butler, 1997: 5). It is perhaps unsurprising that the films of Buñuel should generally escape such instrumentalization, given Surrealism’s allergy towards identitarian frameworks, whether at the personal or national level (“la patrie” was, after all, one of the quasi-theological roots of evil for the Surrealists);^[“Tout est à faire, tous les moyens doivent être bons à employer pour ruiner les idées de *famille*, de *patrie*, de *religion*” (“Everything must be done, all means should be employed to heap ruin upon the ideas of family, of fatherland, of religion”, Breton 1985 \[1930\]: 77).] it is perhaps more surprising that it is at the very level of *popular* discourse that Buñuel’s films are able to mobilize affect precisely as a mode of excess and extasis, of the radical decoding of flows.

Jesús Martín Barbero, while affirming interpellation as the basic articulating mechanism by which cinema “mediates” the aspirations and political interests of the working classes and the national-hegemonic strategies of the ruling élites of the 1930s, ’40s and ’50s, nevertheless sees the process as fundamentally driven in this period by the popular demand for recognition arising from the social movements which impel a crisis of hegemony:

> La peculiaridad del modo como las masas latinoamericanas se hacen presentes en la escena social tiene que ver en últimas con la *doble interpelación* que las moviliza desde el momento de la explosión urbana: una interpelación de clase que sólo es percibida por una minoría y una interpelación popular-nacional que alcanza a las mayorías. \[… E\]l papel decisivo que los medios masivos juegan en ese período residió en su capacidad de hacerse voceros de la interpelación que desde el populismo convertía a las masas en pueblo y al pueblo en Nación. Interpelación que venia del Estado pero que sólo fue eficaz en la medida en que las masas reconocieron en ella algunas de sus demandas más básicas y la presencia de sus modos de expresión. (1998: 176–79)^[“The peculiarity of the way in which the Latin American masses erupt onto the social stage has, in the end, to do with the *double interpellation* which mobilizes them from the onset of the urban explosion: a class interpellation which is only perceived by a minority, and a national-popular interpellation which addresses the majority. \[… T\]he decisive role which the mass media play in this period resides in their capacity to become mediators of the interpellation which, under populism, was transforming the mass into people, and the people into Nation. An interpellation which originated with the State, but which was only effective insofar as the masses recognized in it some of their most basic demands and their modes and forms of expression.”]

For the later Monsiváis, also, the work of identity construction is no longer a simple process of “learning” (even if it is the learning of *gestus* and *habitus*), but is actually highly equivocal, involving a dual process of “mystification” and “destruction”: on the one hand a primary investiture similar to commodity fetishism, and on the other the dissolution of traditions, religious frameworks and community ties in a process which he calls “secularization”. Here Monsiváis does not merely reproduce a narrative of becoming or interpellation through filmic imaginaries of the post-Revolutionary subject, but also points towards cinema’s effective and affective disarticulation of older social hierarchies, be they of family, religion or gender. For what is much more interesting than the bland narrative of culture in the service of specular identity-expression (or construction) — a nationalist identity paradigm within which much of the literature on Mexican visual culture remains caught (see for example Mraz, 2009) — is the extent to which Mexican cinema of the Golden Age *disarticulated* identities, disembedded peasant culture from its “organic” rootedness in the rhythms of the countryside and agricultural production, and conjoined it both to increasing urbanization (with its attendant industrialization) and to the forms and formats of an incipient transnational visual imaginary dominated largely (but not exclusively) by Hollywood.
